### Code Packages

[respect](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/respect):  Python package to perform recursive, binary partitioning via thresholding of the Laplacian Feidler vector.

[submet](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/submet):  Python package to compute various distances and metrics between equi-dimensional subspaces.  Metrics include: Asimov, Binet-Cauchy, Chordal, Fubini-Study, Grassmann, Martin, Procrustes, Projection, and Spectral.

[fieldmodel](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/fieldmodel):  Python package to fit brain connectivity field models (as originally described [here](https://www.spinozacentre.nl/dumoulin/PDFs/Haak-NI-2013.pdf)).  I provide methods to fit Geodesic field models (on a manifold) and Connective field models (original implementation in 3D-voxel space), along with the option to fit either Gaussian or Student's T densities.

[statsni](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/statsni):  Python implementations of various multivariate statistical tests.  Constantly growing as I find the need / desire to learn about new methods.

[probtrackx3](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/ptx3): C++ package containing modifications to the [FSL probtrackx2](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FDT/UserGuide#PROBTRACKX_-_probabilistic_tracking_with_crossing_fibres) probabilistic fiber tracking algorithm for diffusion MRI.  **These modifications have not been endorsed by and did not involve [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki).**
  
[ddCRP](https://kristianeschenburg.github.io/ddCRP/): Python package for fitting distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process models

[meshica](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/meshica):  Python wrappers and implementations of [Canonical ICA](https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4650) (CanICA) and [MELODIC's Iterative Group PCA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289914/) (MIGP) algorithms for time-series data sampled on a mesh

[niio](https://kristianeschenburg.github.io/niio/):  Python package for quickly loading and writing neuroimaging data in GIFTI format

[parcellation_fragmenter](https://kristianeschenburg.github.io/parcellation_fragmenter/):  Python package for fragmenting annotation and label files into parameterized number of clusters.  Useful for feature extraction and generating null models of cortical maps.

[surface_utilities](https://github.com/kristianeschenburg/surface_utilities): Package for quickly processing surface meshes and cortical maps to generate adjacency lists and graphs.
