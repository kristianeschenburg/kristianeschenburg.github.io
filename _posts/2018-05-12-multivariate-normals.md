In this post, I'll be covering the basics of Multivariate Normal Distributions, with special emphasis on deriving the conditional and marginal distributions.

Given a random variable under the usual Gauss-Markov assumptions, with $$y_{i} \sim N(\mu, \sigma^{2})$$ with $$e \sim N(0,\sigma^{2})$$, and $$N$$ independent samples $$y_{1}...y_{n}$$, we can define vector $$\mathbf{y} = [y_{1}, y_{2},...y_{n}] \sim N_{n}(\mathbf{\mu},\sigma^{2}I)$$ with $$\mathbf{e} \sim N_{n}(\mathbf{0},\sigma^{2}I)$$.  We can see from the covariance structure of the errors that all off-diagonal elements are 0, indicating that our samples are independent with equal variances.

**Marginal Distributions**

Now assume that $$\mathbf{y} = \[\mathbf{y_{1}}, \mathbf{y_{2}} \] \sim N(\mathbf{\mu},\Sigma)$$, where $$\mathbf{\mu} = \begin{bmatrix} \mu_{1} \\ \mu_{2} \end{bmatrix}$$, and $$\Sigma$$ is an arbitrary covariance matrix, where we cannot assume independence.  If $$\Sigma$$ is non-singular, we can decompose $$\Sigma$$ as

$$ \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
\Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{21}^{T} \\
\Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix}$$

and, using the inversion lemmas from [Blockwise Matrix Inversion]({% post_url 2018-05-08-blockwise-matrix-inversion %}), define its inverse $$\Sigma^{-1} = V$$ as

$$
V = \begin{bmatrix}
V_{11} & V_{21}^{T} \\
V_{21} & V_{22} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
(\Sigma_{11} - \Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}\Sigma_{21})^{-1} & -\Sigma^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1} \\
-\Sigma_{22}^{-1}\Sigma_{21}(\Sigma_{11}-\Sigma_{12}\Sigma_{22}^{-1}\Sigma_{21})^{-1} & (\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}
\end{bmatrix}$$

From the properties of transformations of Normal random variables, we can define the marginal of $$y_{1}$$ as

$$\begin{align}
By \sim N(B\mu,B\Sigma B^{T})
\end{align}$$

where $$B = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ such that

$$ \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\mu_{1}} \\ \mathbf{\mu_{2}} \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{\mu_{1}}$$
$$\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I} & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\
\Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{I} \\
0
\end{bmatrix} = \Sigma_{11}$$

so that $$\mathbf{y_{1}} \sim N(\mathbf{\mu_{1}},\Sigma_{11})$$.


**Conditional Distributions**

Showing the conditional distribution is a bit long-winded, so bear with me.  We are interested in finding the distribution of $$y_{2}\mid y_{1}$$, which we can explicitly represent as

$$\begin{align}
f_{y_{1}}(y_{2} \mid y_{1}) = \frac{f_{y_{1},y_{2}}(y_{1},y_{2})}{f_{y_{1}}(y_{1})}
\end{align}$$

Writing out the joint density for $$y$$, we have the following

$$\begin{align}
f(y) =  \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{n/2}\mid \Sigma \mid ^{1/2}}\exp^{(-1/2)(y-\mu)^{T}\Sigma^{-1}(y-\mu)}
\end{align}$$

Partitioning this expression up into the individual terms related to $$y_{1}$$ and $$y_{2}$$, the exponent becomes

$$ (y-\mu)^{T}V(y-\mu) = \begin{bmatrix}
y_{1} - \mu_{1} \\
y_{2} - \mu_{2} \end{bmatrix}^{T}
\begin{bmatrix}
V_{11} & V_{12} \\
V_{21} & V_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
y_{1} - \mu_{1} \\
y_{2} - \mu_{2}
\end{bmatrix}$$

Expanding this quadratic form out, we see that we end up with

$$\begin{align}
(y_{1} - \mu_{1})^{T} V_{11}^{-1}(y_{1}-\mu_{1}) + 2(y_{1}-\mu_{1})^{T}V_{12}(y_{2}-\mu_{2}) + (y_{2} - \mu_{2})^{T}V_{22}(y_{2}-\mu_{2})
\end{align}$$

Let us, for simpliciy set $$z_{1} = (y_{1} - \mu_{1})$$ and $$z_{2} = (y_{2} - \mu_{2})$$.  Substituting back in our definitions of $$V_{11}$,$V_{12}$,$V_{21}$$, and $$V_{22}$$, and and using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury definition for $$V_{11}$$, we have the following

$$\begin{align}
&z_{1}^{T}(\Sigma_{11}^{-1} + \Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}\Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11})z_{1} \\
&- 2z_{1}^{T}(\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}^{-1})^{-1})z_{2} \\
&+ z_{2}^{T}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1})z_{2}
\end{align}$$

which, by distribution of $$z_{1}$$ across the first term and splitting the second term into its two sums, we have

$$\begin{align}
&z_{1}^{T}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{11} + z_{1}^{T}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}V_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}\Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{1} \\
&- z_{1}^{T}(\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1})z_{2} - z_{1}^{T}(\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1})z_{2} \\
&+ z_{2}^{T}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1})z_{2}
\end{align}$$


We can pull out forms $$z_{1}^{T}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(\Sigma_{22}-\Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}$$ to the left and $$(\Sigma_{22}-\Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}z_{2}$$ to the right and, after applying a transpose, have

$$\begin{align}
=z_{1}^{T}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{11} + (z_{2} -\Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{1})^{T}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}(z_{2} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{1})
\end{align}$$

Plugging the above back into our exponential term in our original density function, we see that we have a product of two exponential terms

$$\begin{align}
&\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{p/2}\mid \Sigma_{11} \mid^{1/2}} \exp(\frac{-1}{2}(z_{1}^{T}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{11})) \\
\end{align}$$

and

$$\begin{align}
&\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{q/2}\mid \Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12} \mid ^{1/2}}\exp(\frac{-1}{2}(z_{2} - z_{1}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{T}(\Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12})^{-1}(z_{2} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}z_{1}))
\end{align}$$

where the first term is the marginal density of $$y_{1}$$ and the second is the conditional density of $$y_{2} \mid y_{1}$$ with conditional mean $$\mu_{2\mid 1} = \mu_{2} + \Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}(y_{1} - \mu_{1})$$ and conditional variance $$\Sigma_{2\mid 1} = \Sigma_{22} - \Sigma_{21}\Sigma_{11}^{-1}\Sigma_{12}$$.

While long and drawn out, the formulas show that the conditional distribution of any subset of Normal random variables, given another subset, is also a Normal distribution, with conditional mean and variance defined by functions of the means and covariances of the original random vector.
